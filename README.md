👋 Hi there, I'm **Boyalla Sumanth Reddy**!

🔍 Enthusiastic about continuous learning and research.

I utilize GitHub to refine my programming and research skills, contributing to meaningful projects.

📚✍️ Voracious reader and prolific writer.

I immerse myself in research papers and non-fiction books. In my free (and not-so-free) time, I write on blogs, magazines, forums, and various platforms where my voice can be heard. I often write under pseudonyms to maintain anonymity and cater to specific audiences.

🚀 Aspiring entrepreneur working towards creating a startup company.

My primary tools include MS Word, MS Excel, PowerPoint, and VS Code.

🌐 Strong believer in open-source projects and collaborative efforts.

I advocate for open-source and collaboration as they accelerate progress in both technical and academic fields.

🌱 Lifelong learner and self-improver.

"Who isn't?" one might ask. "I thrive on being inherently curious," I would respond.

🤝 Feel free to reach out for any queries, feedback, or communication.

My interests evolve over time. I experiment with various languages and tech stacks, so expect this section to be updated frequently.

### Technical Skills

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS
- **Backend:** Python, Java
- **Research:** OracID

### Software Skills

As mentioned before, I experiment a lot. Here are some of the software tools I use regularly:

- **Programming:** VS Code, Sublime, Jupyter, Flask
- **Media Editing:** Adobe Tools (Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, etc.), Inkscape

I usually use these tools in conjunction, even though this seems like an exhaustive list. This is not a complete list, as I am quite flexible about working with many tools.

For example, you can see I have more than one type of text editor for programming. Each has its own uses. For example, Neovim is primarily for programming, but VS Code is great for collaborative programming. Sublime is surprisingly fast to run in a small portable non-CLI environment.

### Closing Thoughts

All the tools and skills mentioned here play a significant role in my research, learning, and programming endeavors. This is not a complete list since I work on various projects frequently. I regularly try out new applications and phase out the old ones.

This is common in the digital world — new applications emerge, and old applications fade away.

But the best ones endure. And I aspire to be one...
